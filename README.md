My first 2D game. If you want to test it, you need to install MiniLibx. MiniLibX is a tiny graphics library which allows you to do the most basic things for rendering something in screens without any knowledge of X-Window and Cocoa. It provides so-called simple window creation, a questionable drawing tool, half-ass image functions and a weird event management system. https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux that repository can help to solve this problem.
